How Does it Work:
- Compares 2 images side by side using a slider

How to Use:
- Place the 2 images that you want to compare in the folder named "image" 
  (The "image" folder can be found inside "dist")

- Open the image_slider.exe

- The program will first ask the user to input 2 filename (you also need to include the file extension)

- After the program detects the the file, then you can start using it
  (If it doesn't start, then make sure that the filename are already correct)


Notice: You can only slide from the left side of the image which can be seen at test.png as an example
