How Does it Work:
- Compares 2 images side by side using a slider

How to Use:
1. Place the 2 images that you want to compare in the image folder
  (The "image" folder can be found inside dist)

2. Open the image_slider.exe in the dist folder

3. The program will first ask the user to input 2 filename (you also need to include the file extension)

4. After the program detects the the file, then you can start using it
  (If it doesn't start, make sure that the file is placed at the correct folder; refer to number 1)
  (If it still doesn't start, check whether the filename are correct)


Notice: You can only slide from the left side of the image which can be seen at test.png as an example
